## Professional Experience

### DevOps Intern – Makara Media

Following the **DevOps System Administrator training at O'Clock**, I completed an internship at **Makara Media**, where I worked on real-world DevOps and infrastructure topics, including:

- Deployment and maintenance of containerized applications  
- Automation of infrastructure and system configuration  
- Participation in CI/CD pipelines  
- Basic monitoring and reliability practices  
- Collaboration with technical teams in a production-oriented environment  

This internship allowed me to apply DevOps concepts in real conditions and strengthened my interest in automation, reliability, and infrastructure management.

## Background

I initially trained as a **Full-Stack Web Developer** at **Wild Code School**, where I worked with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Node.js (Express), and SQL databases.

After a first internship at **OP-RATE**, where I discovered DevOps practices, I worked for nearly two years as a **Power Platform Developer**. During this time, my interest in DevOps continued to grow, which led me to enroll in the **DevOps System Administrator program at O'Clock**, which I successfully completed with a degree obtained.

This mixed background allows me to understand both development and infrastructure challenges and to communicate effectively with different technical profiles.
